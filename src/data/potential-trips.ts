            "Missions trips are a powerful way for churches to get involved in the work of Lampei while providing opportunities for believers to move beyond their comfort zones, use their spiritual gifts, and help further the Gospel in new areas.",
            "Lampei seeks to reach the nations through church planting, leadership development, and education. For this reason the ministry options are plentiful. Examples include: sports camps, vacation Bible school, open concerts, medical missions, door-to-door evangelism, open air evangelism, and teaching Pastors.",
            "No matter the location, opportunities for the furtherance of Gospel are unlimited. Is God calling you to come on a short term mission trip with Lampei?"
