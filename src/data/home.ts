        quote: "Prior to becoming a college president, I spent many years planting churches in difficult places. I have known hundreds, if not thousands, who have responded to the need to fulfill the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus through planting churches. Quite frankly most who set out to do so quit within the first 18 months. However, the leaders of Lampei International Ministries stand the test of time and have a proven track record of not just talking about church planting but actually planting churches that are making a difference for eternity.",

Recently, I visited the churches of Lampei International Ministries in Morelia, Mexico, and clearly heard the Spirit of God speak into my heart.  The vision of this ministry for evangelism, education, and worship ranks at the very top of those ministries I have seen in my lifetime.  Lampei is doing it right, according to the Biblical pattern.  My endorsement of their project is without qualification",

From March 16-17, 2023, I had the privilege of working with Lampei Church in Morelia, Mexico and saw God work in amazing ways as we reached out in different schools and neighborhoods. We saw hundreds of people come to know Jesus Christ! We were even able to share the Gospel through a scientific presentation of Intelligent Design in a local university and it was wonderful to see dozens of the students pray to receive Christ. I highly recommend the LIM and their leadership for an exciting opportunity to reach people with the Gospel. They are doing a great job reaching Morelia, Mexico!",
